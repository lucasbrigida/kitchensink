# KitchenSink - Xamarin.Forms Examples

I created the kitchen sink to learn and understand some of the basics of Xamarin.Forms and Prism. This example shows some of the layouts, views & controls that can be made using Xamarin.Forms and Prism. The idea is to act like a reference guide to help when building using Xamarin.Forms to build native apps. I'll continue to add to this example, I've provided a list of future features if you want to see what's planned.

All contributions are welcomed!
